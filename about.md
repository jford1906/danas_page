    <p>My name is Jeff Ford and I am a visiting instructor in the <a href="http://gustavus.edu/mcs">Department of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics</a> at <a href="http://gustavus.edu">Gustavus Adolphus College</a> in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Qkz7sGTEhqE2">Saint Peter, MN</a>.  

    <p>My primary research interests are in topology, dynamical systems, and mathematics education. At the moment, I'm working on the construction of measure preserving dynamical systems. Regarding math education, I'm interested in Inquiry-based and Team-based teaching methods, and their effect on students mathematical self-efficacy.</p>

I am always interseted in working with students on research. If you are a GAC student interested in conducting research in mathematics, please come talk to me! I've worked in the past with students on curriculum design, and am currently working with a student on a project in axiomatic set theory.

<!--My interests also include the [scholarship of teaching and learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship_of_Teaching_and_Learning) (SoTL) with a focus on [inquiry-based learning](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-heck-is-ibl.html) (IBL) as an approach to teaching/exploring mathematics. I am currently a Special Projects Coordinator for the [Academy of Inquiry-Based Learning](http://www.inquirybasedlearning.org) and a mentor for several new IBL practitioners.  Moreover, I actively give [talks]({{ site.baseurl }}/scholarship/talks/) and organize workshops on the benefits of IBL as well as the nuts and bolts of how to implement this approach in the mathematics classroom. -->

<!-- I am also interested in utilizing technology to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. Specifically, I choose free and [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) software and technologies when appropriate. For example, I have been incorporating [Sage](http://sagemath.org) and [GeoGebra](http://www.geogebra.org/) into my teaching. Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under the GPL. It combines the power of many existing open-source packages into a common Python-based interface.  For examples of a few of the cool things you can do with Sage, check [this page](http://wiki.sagemath.org/interact).  According to their webpage, GeoGebra is free and multi-platform dynamic mathematics software for all levels of education that joins geometry, algebra, tables, graphing, statistics and calculus in one easy-to-use package.  There are tons of awesome GeoGebra examples located [here](http://www.geogebratube.org).  For other examples of the software that I use for teaching and staying productive, check out my [resources page](href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources/). -->

<!-- In addition to using free and open-source software, I am inspired by the recent [open-source textbook](http://iae-pedia.org/Open_Source_Textbooks) movement and I strongly believe that educators should choose free, open-source, or low cost textbooks when a viable alternative exists. For a selection of free and/or open-source textbooks, see my list located [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/free-and-open-source-textbooks/). Also, take a peek at [Rob Beezer’s](http://buzzard.ups.edu) selection on [this page](http://linear.ups.edu/opentexts.html).  Moreover, the [American Institute of Mathematics](http://www.aimath.org) maintains a list of [approved open-source textbooks](http://www.aimath.org/textbooks/textbooklist.html). If you find one of the books list on any of the above links more helpful than another, please [let me know](mailto:dana.ernst@nau.edu).   -->

<!-- [Angie Hodge](http://www.unomaha.edu/math/people/hodge/) and I are coauthors for [Math Ed Matters](http://maamathedmatters.blogspot.com), which is a (roughly) monthly column sponsored by the [Mathematical Association of America](http://maa.org).  The column explores topics and current events related to undergraduate mathematics education. Posts aim to inspire, provoke deep thought, and provide ideas for the mathematics classroom. Our interest in and engagement with IBL color the column's content. -->

<!-- Besides blogging here and for Math Ed Matters, I am also an editor for [Mathblogging.org](http://mathblogging.org), which is a site devoted to aggregating the multitude of math-related blogs and news sources across the Internet.  My job as editor is to select a blog posts to be included in the [Editors' Picks List](http://www.mathblogging.org/posts?type=post&amp;filter0=recommender-status&amp;value0=editor). -->
